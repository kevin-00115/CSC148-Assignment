# CSC148-Assignment

This is my Assignment 2 for CSC 148 Introduction to Computer Science at UofT
It is the year 3142. Robots have finally overtaken the world, and their society involves a very strict hierarchy where every robot knows their place in society. (Also, it should be noted that humans had obviously re-located to Mars by this time, so the planet which the robots have overtaken is Mars, not Earth.) As we've discussed in class, trees are a fundamental data structure used to model all sorts of hierarchical data. In this assignment, you will be modelling the organization of the Martian Robot Society using trees.

Every robot in the Martian Robot Society is considered a citizen of Mars. The nodes in our tree will each represent one citizen. Citizens all have subordinate-superior relationships, where one citizen may work under another. Additionally, some citizens are leaders of a specific district within the society. All citizens that work under a leader are considered part of that district.

Note that a district could be a geographical area, or just a domain of responsibility, like Finance.

My solution demonstrates understanding of following concepts:
1. Recursive tree methods
2. Object Oriented Programming
